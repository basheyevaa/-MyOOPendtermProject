Hello!

This is my project from OOP Java course.

I have used graphics there.

You can create a class and extend it to the JFrame and create variables as jButton1, jButton2, etc. and use the constructorto set some properties as setBackground, setColor, etc..

I have created all the jPanels, jLabels, jbuttons automatically using a function "Create->New Frame->...".
then all the constructing methods and declarations of variables will be written in the source code by default. Remember! You cannot change them, otherwise you will have ClassNotFound and other exeptions when you run the project.

You sould run the JavaApplication1 project.

Firstly there opens a homepage where we have 3 buttons: instructions (there are print scrin images of how you should use the app), test (consists of 2 separate forms as test1 and test2), contact (information about the author).

You can click on the button test1 and pass the first quiz, if yoou did not select some questions, the points for these questions will not be given.

When you click the button check you will get your total score on jTextfield.

If you will have questions regarding to the source code or anything else feel free to send me email messages.
